//! Spaces: named document collections with a sqlite-vec vector store (spec unit U16).
//!
//! A *Space* is a named collection of documents. Each ingested document is split
//! into chunks; every chunk is embedded into a fixed-dimension vector and stored
//! in a [sqlite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) `vec0` virtual table so
//! that future retrieval (U17) can run KNN queries over it. The plain `spaces`,
//! `documents`, and `chunks` tables hold the human-readable rows; the `vec0` table
//! holds only the vector, keyed by the chunk rowid.
//!
//! ## GraphRAG retrieval mode (spec unit U046)
//!
//! A Space can carry a `retrieval_mode` of `"vector"` (default) or `"graph"`.
//! When set to `"graph"`, ingestion additionally extracts normalized terms and
//! directed within-chunk co-occurrence pairs into `graph_nodes` / `graph_edges`.
//! `SpaceStore::search` then branches on the mode: vector mode runs the existing
//! KNN query; graph mode runs entity-matching + BFS traversal and returns the
//! grounded chunks reachable from the query's entities.
//!
//! `RYU_GRAPH_EXTRACTION_MODEL` / `registry.json` `graph_extraction_model` select
//! the implementation. `local-cooccurrence` is the only shipped value and is
//! deterministic/offline; unsupported ids fail store creation instead of being
//! accepted while the local algorithm runs silently.
//!
//! ## Migration
//!
//! The `retrieval_mode` column and the `graph_nodes`/`graph_edges` tables are added
//! with idempotent DDL (`ALTER TABLE … IF NOT EXISTS` / `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
//! EXISTS`), so existing Spaces databases are upgraded in-place on first open
//! without losing data.
//!
//! Placement rationale (Core vs Gateway, see CLAUDE.md §1): a document collection
//! and its embeddings are part of *what runs* (orchestration / RAG inputs), not
//! *what is allowed/measured/paid*, so Spaces belong in Core. This mirrors the
//! U10 `ConversationStore` shape exactly.
//!
//! Encryption-at-rest direction: when `RYU_SPACES_KEY` is set we issue a
//! `PRAGMA key`. On a stock (non-SQLCipher) SQLite build this pragma is silently
//! ignored, so it compiles and runs cleanly today; flipping rusqlite to
//! `bundled-sqlcipher` later turns it into real at-rest encryption with no code
//! change. We also restrict the db file permissions on Unix. See `apply_encryption`.

    ///    hands it to clients. Repointing it at 400 KB of extracted markdown changes
    ///    what every file document returns, irreversibly — the descriptor is not
    ///    recoverable afterwards.
    /// 2. It runs [`store_doc_links`] over the new source, so `[[…]]`-shaped text
    ///    inside an *uploaded PDF* would mint wiki links, then unresolve and
    ///    re-resolve inbound links as if the page had been renamed.
    /// 3. It has nowhere to express "these chunks came from extraction" versus
    ///    "these chunks are the descriptor" — the distinction the caller's index
    ///    status is built on.
    ///
    /// So this is deliberately the *middle third* of [`Self::update_document_blocking`]
    /// and nothing else: drop the old chunk/vector/graph rows, insert the new ones,
    /// bump the Space. Title, `source`, and the link graph are untouched.

/// **Always compare within a session.** Free disk space moves the absolute figures

/// full, and re-running the ordered shape once the volume had ~56 GB free landed
/// materially lower again (406 KB: 7.46 s → 3.77 s) with no code change whatsoever.
/// That is why the claim made here is a ratio and never a wall clock.
///
/// **Read the on-disk column anyway.** A real Space is a file, so on-disk is the
/// production number, and at 1,566 chunks it is still **~16 s** of uninterruptible
/// SQLite work inside ONE transaction, from one UI click. What changed is the
/// *shape*: per-chunk cost used to grow with the Space (20 → 24 → 29–55 ms) as
/// `graph_edges` and its indexes outgrew the page cache, and is now flat at ~10 ms
/// across a 16× range. A bigger Space is finally a straight multiple rather than
/// worse than one — so extrapolate linearly, which the previous version of this
/// paragraph explicitly told you not to do.
///
/// Order of magnitude — seconds to tens of seconds — is all the precision the "can
/// this block a runtime worker" question needs, and it is the precision these
/// numbers actually support. Concurrent load inflates them further.
///
/// The shape is `O(chunks × entities²)`. Both factors are bounded differently:
/// - **entities per chunk is bounded by a constant.** [`chunk_text`] appends a word
///   only while the running chunk stays under [`CHUNK_CHAR_SIZE`], so a chunk holds
///   ≲ 250 tokens of ≥ 3 chars and therefore ≤ ~250 distinct entities → ≤ ~62,250
///   edges. (`chunk_text` breaks *before* appending, so a single token longer than
///   `CHUNK_CHAR_SIZE` does produce one oversized chunk — but one giant token is
///   one entity, so it cannot inflate the fan-out.)
/// - **chunk count is NOT bounded.** It is whatever the caller hands over. That is
///   the dimension to budget for.
///
/// # Every path that can reach this function runs off the async worker
///
/// That is the checkable claim, and here is the whole set to check it against —
/// **two callers, reached from four public paths, all four of which can carry graph
/// work** (`grep 'build_graph_for_chunks('`; and `grep 'INTO graph_nodes\|INTO
/// graph_edges'` returns only this function's two prepared statements, so nothing
/// writes graph rows around it — `reindex_all` re-embeds vectors and never touches
/// the graph tables):
///
/// - caller 1 — `set_retrieval_mode_blocking`, i.e.
///   [`SpaceStore::set_retrieval_mode`]: passes **every chunk in the Space** from a
///   single UI click, with no upper bound at all.
/// - caller 2 — `insert_chunks`, itself reached from three places:
///   - [`SpaceStore::ingest_document`] and [`SpaceStore::update_document`] pass
///     **one document's** chunks — which is not a bound either, since one uploaded
///     book is one document;
///   - [`SpaceStore::create_file`] passes the file's single descriptor chunk
///     (`title` + `mime`). It used to hardcode `RetrievalMode::Vector` and so never
///     reached this function — which meant a file added to a graph-mode Space got no
///     graph rows, while `set_retrieval_mode`'s rebuild (which scans that same chunk
///     row) *did* give it some. That inconsistency is fixed; the budget note is that
///     the descriptor is **not** split by [`chunk_text`] and `title` is uncapped at
///     the HTTP/MCP entry points, so this path's fan-out is bounded by the caller's
///     filename, not by `CHUNK_CHAR_SIZE`.
///
/// All four graph-carrying paths now wrap their transaction in
/// [`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`]. Ingest used to be inline, on the reasoning that
/// "one document" was a smaller input than "a whole Space" — true, and irrelevant:
/// the per-chunk cost is this same `O(chunks × entities²)` fan-out either way, so a
/// large upload parked a runtime worker for exactly as long as its own chunk count
/// implied. `graph_ingest_does_not_occupy_the_async_worker` is the guard; it counted
/// **0** scheduler ticks against the inline shape.
///
/// (The table above is *not* a measurement of ingest — it times a cold
/// `set_retrieval_mode` rebuild over already-stored chunks, whereas ingest also
/// embeds and writes `chunk_vectors`. Nobody has measured ingest end to end; if you
/// need its real number, measure it rather than reusing these digits.)
///
/// The per-row work is a bound-and-step on ONE prepared statement per table,
/// hoisted out of the loops: `rusqlite`'s `Transaction::execute` re-parses and
/// re-plans its SQL on every call, so the old shape paid one parse per row. A/B'd
/// in a single process over an identical 392-chunk / 1,279,718-edge corpus, run in
/// both orderings so cache warmth cannot explain the gap:
///
/// | ordering       | `execute` per row | one prepared statement |
/// |----------------|-------------------|------------------------|
/// | prepared first |            4.93 s |                 3.75 s |
/// | `execute` first|            5.03 s |                 3.88 s |
///
/// **≈23 % off**, with byte-identical output (22,592 nodes / 1,279,718 edges either
/// way). So the parse was real but never dominant: the remaining ~3.8 s is b-tree
/// insertion into `graph_edges` and its **three** indexes.
///
/// Three, not two — and the third is the interesting one. `idx_graph_edges_space_src`
/// and `idx_graph_edges_space_dst` are declared; the third is the
/// `sqlite_autoindex_*` SQLite materialises for `id TEXT PRIMARY KEY`, because only
/// an `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` aliases the rowid. That index was invisible in the
/// schema and in the sentence this replaces, which used to end:
///
/// > *Nothing short of writing fewer rows changes the order of magnitude.*
///
/// **That was wrong, and it was wrong for the same reason "affordable enough to run
/// inline" was wrong before it: nobody had looked.** Feeding that hidden index a v4
/// UUID per row meant every insert landed at a uniformly random point in the key
/// space, so once it outgrew the page cache each row dirtied its own page. Replacing
/// the UUID with the ascending [`graph_row_id`] — same rows, same columns, same
/// counts, one fewer random write per row — took the chat-attachment path
/// **2–5× faster**, measured by `measure_attachment_stall`, A/B'd in both orderings
/// (v4 UUID → ordered → v4 UUID) so cache warmth cannot explain it:
///
/// | corpus | chunks | edge rows | v4 UUID id  | ordered id | speed-up |
/// |--------|--------|-----------|-------------|------------|----------|
/// |   8 KB |      8 |    26,106 | 236 / 129ms |  103–114ms |  ~1.2–2× |

///
/// Two figures in the UUID column because its run-to-run spread is ~2×, and that
/// spread is not noise — it *is* the mechanism, since the cost depends on how much
/// of a randomly-addressed index happens to be resident. The ordered column varies
/// by ~10 %. Note also that per-chunk cost stopped growing with corpus size (v4:
/// 29 → 94 ms/chunk; ordered: 13 → 19 ms/chunk): the super-linearity was the random
/// index outgrowing cache, not the algorithm.
///
/// One caveat on those numbers: they were taken against a **fresh** database. An
/// existing install's graph tables already hold random UUID keys, so ordered ids
/// cluster into one region of that key space rather than appending past its end. The
/// locality win holds — all new ids share a 22-character prefix and so hit one hot
/// region — but the upgrade case was not measured.
///
/// Unlike the table above, that A/B is a **one-off against code that no longer
/// exists** — there is no harness to re-run, because keeping one would mean keeping
/// a second copy of the graph builder in the test module, and "one definition of
/// what a Space's graph looks like" is the property this function exists to hold.
/// Take the 23 % as history explaining why the current shape was chosen, not as a
/// number to re-verify.
///
/// Extraction deliberately caps a chunk at [`MAX_EXTRACTED_GRAPH_TERMS`]. That is a
/// retrieval-quality trade: source-order terms beyond the cap cannot become graph
/// bridges, but one adversarial title or chunk also cannot create unbounded
/// quadratic rows. The multi-hop and fan-out tests pin both the retained behavior
/// and the exact `n·(n−1)` shape inside the cap.
///
/// Note on `INSERT OR IGNORE`: `graph_nodes`/`graph_edges` have no UNIQUE
/// constraint beyond their `id` primary key, and [`graph_row_id`] cannot collide
/// (see its doc), so the conflict clause never actually fires today — it is inert,
/// not a de-duplicator. Callers that may run over chunks whose rows already exist
/// MUST delete the space's rows first (as `set_retrieval_mode` does), or they will
/// double-insert. **This is the constraint any future id scheme has to satisfy**: a
/// collidable id would make the clause fire and drop an edge with no error anywhere.
///
/// # What this function still does NOT fix: it holds the global connection mutex
///
/// `SpaceStore` is one `Connection` behind one `tokio::Mutex`, and every caller
/// takes that mutex for the whole transaction. So the cost above is not merely the
/// caller's latency — it is a **node-wide stall**: while a graph-mode attachment is
/// indexed, every other Space's search, every sidebar list, every concurrent upload
/// waits. `measure_attachment_stall` measures exactly that, by racing a
/// `count_spaces()` probe against the ingest, and it reports the probe's worst
/// latency as equal to the whole call to the millisecond — i.e. 100 % of the work is
/// lock-held, at every size.
///
/// [`graph_row_id`] shrank that stall by 2–5×; it did not change its shape. Two
/// follow-ups remain, both deliberately out of scope here:
///
/// - **Batch the graph phase across several transactions**, taking the mutex per
///   batch, so the *hold* is bounded by batch size rather than by document size.
///   Cheap to describe, not cheap to land: it moves the graph write out of the chunk
///   write's transaction (a crash between them leaves chunks with a partial graph,
///   repairable only by re-asserting the retrieval mode), and because
///   `graph_nodes.chunk_id`/`graph_edges.chunk_id` are `REFERENCES chunks(id)` under
///   `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`, a chunk deleted by a concurrent writer between two
///   batches turns today's benign race into a hard FK failure — each batch would
///   have to re-check that its chunks still exist.
/// - **A second write connection** for ingest, so bulk graph writes stop sharing a
///   mutex with interactive reads at all. That is the structural fix; the mutex, not
///   this function, is the thing that makes one slow write everyone's problem.
///
/// [`SpaceStore::set_retrieval_mode`] is the same stall an order of magnitude worse
/// (a whole-Space rebuild from one UI click) and got the same speed-up for free —
/// 46–87 s down to 16.3 s at 1,566 chunks. Sixteen seconds of node-wide freeze is
/// still a defect; it is just no longer a minute and a half of one.
///
/// The returned counts accumulate each `execute`'s **rows-affected** return value,
/// not the number of statements issued. Those are equal today precisely because the
/// conflict clause is inert — but the counts are surfaced to callers as "how big is
/// this Space's graph", and a reported number that stops matching what is stored is
/// the second defect class this work exists to remove. Reading rows-affected makes
/// them right by construction, so adding the UNIQUE index the note above invites
/// cannot silently turn these into over-reports.
