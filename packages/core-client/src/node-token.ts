// request through — so any process on the machine could drive the whole local
// API. Now that a token exists, a surface that does not present it gets a 401.
//
// Surfaces Core SPAWNS (sidecars, ACP agents, the gateway) inherit `RYU_TOKEN`
// from Core's environment and need none of this. Surfaces that run as their own
// process — the TUI, the MCP server, the CLI, the desktop — are not children of
// Core, so they read the file instead.
//
// NODE-ONLY. This imports `node:fs`/`node:os` and must never be pulled into a
// browser bundle; browser surfaces (the webapp, the extension) cannot read a
// local file at all and pair with the node explicitly instead.

 * The bearer to present to the Core at `coreUrl`, or `null` when there is none.

 * Precedence mirrors Core's own resolution so a surface can never disagree with
 * the node it is talking to:
 *   1. `RYU_CORE_TOKEN` — the explicit per-surface override (an operator
 *      pointing a TUI at a REMOTE node, with that node's token).
 *   2. `RYU_TOKEN` — an operator-provisioned node token; this is what Core
 *      itself prefers, and spawned children inherit it. Under the shared-fleet
 *      convention the same value is installed on every node, so it is valid to
 *      send to a remote node too.
 *   3. `<ryu_home>/node-auth.token` — the token Core MINTED for itself. This one
 *      is machine-local, so it is only used when `coreUrl` is local.
 *
 * That last gate is the security-relevant one. `RYU_CORE_URL` is operator- (or
 * attacker-) controlled; without it, pointing a surface at a remote host would
 * transmit this machine's node-admittance secret to that host, which would then
 * hold full access to the local node. The remote would reject it anyway, so the
 * gate costs nothing. Callers that cannot name a URL get the env tiers only.
 *
 * Returns `null` rather than throwing when the file is absent or unreadable:
 * that is the legitimate "Core has not booted yet" state, and a null bearer is
 * exactly what Core accepts when it has no token configured either.
