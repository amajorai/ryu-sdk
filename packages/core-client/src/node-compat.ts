// packages/core-client/src/node-compat.ts
//
// Whether a client can talk to the node it is pointed at — shared by EVERY
// surface rather than reimplemented per app.
//
// This lived only in `apps/desktop/src/lib/node-compat.ts`, so the island,
// mobile, TUI, web and extension had no version awareness at all: they would
// happily drive a node years newer or older than themselves and fail in whatever
// way that particular mismatch happened to fail. `packages/core-client` is the
// one module all seven already import, so the check belongs here.
//
// Two rules govern everything below, and both are deliberate:
//
//   1. WARN, NEVER BLOCK. A mismatch is always advisory. Refusing to connect can
//      lock someone out of their own node mid-upgrade, and driving a newer node
//      from an older client is a legitimate thing to do — it is how you test a
//      canary node from a stable app.
//   2. FAIL SOFT. Anything unknown (absent version, unparseable version, no
//      capability list) resolves to "fine". A node that predates a field must not
//      be reported as broken because it did not answer a question nobody used to
//      ask.
//
// Feature gating is a SEPARATE question and is answered by `capabilities`, not by
// version arithmetic — see `hasCapability`. That is what lets a client whose
// update window has lapsed keep working against a newer node: it asks what the
// node can do rather than deciding from a version number.
