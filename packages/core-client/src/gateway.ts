// packages/core-client/src/gateway.ts
//
// Typed client for the Gateway observability surface, surfaced through Core's
// read-only proxy (`GET /api/gateway/status`). The proxy fetches the gateway's
// /health and /metrics and returns a combined snapshot, or a clear down state
// (`reachable: false`) when the gateway is unreachable while Core is still up.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT ────────────────────────────────────
//
// It is a *subset fork* of `apps/desktop/src/lib/api/gateway.ts`, not a shared
// core the desktop delegates to. The header above used to literally read
// `// apps/desktop/src/lib/api/gateway.ts`, which is how the two came to drift:
// the desktop file grew evaluators, `modality_map`, `eval_routing`,
// `provider_tiers`, the firewall inspector, budget spend and the classify-tier
// helpers; none of that exists here, and no in-repo surface imports
// `@ryuhq/core-client/gateway` today (grep: zero importers — the desktop imports
// its own copy). Reconciling the two is a real piece of work and deliberately
// out of scope for the fix below.
//
// It is NOT dead code, though, and that is the reason the fix below matters:
// this package publishes to npm as `@ryuhq/core-client` (0.0.14) with an
// `"./*": "./src/*.ts"` export map, so `@ryuhq/core-client/gateway` is a
// supported public entry point for anyone building a surface against Core. Its
// `fetchGatewayConfig` therefore has to hold the same contract the desktop's
// does — in particular it must not fabricate config sections the gateway never
// served. See {@link routingViewIncludesSmartRouting}.
//
// If you extend this file, port the desktop's *reasoning*, not its whole
// surface, and say here which parts are still missing.
