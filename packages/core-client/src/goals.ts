// completion condition attached to a conversation; a separate judge model
// evaluates progress after each turn. Core owns the goal state and the judge
// call (routed through the Gateway); the continuation loop is driven here on the
// client. See apps/core/src/server/mod.rs (goal handlers) and conversations.rs.
